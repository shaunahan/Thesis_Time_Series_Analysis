# Time Series Analysis on the U.S. Unemployment Rate
This repository contains codes used for my thesis on the U.S. unemployment rate time series forecasting. 
The aim of my analysis is to use the unemployment rate time series provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to propose time series models that can accurately forecast the U.S. unemployment rate. Traditional time series models such as ARIMA and ARMA models as well as machine learning algorithms are compared on their prediction performance.

## Time Series Models Used:
- a median model
- simple and multi-linear regressions
- a random walk
- a moving average
- an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
- SVM (machine learning)
- XGBoost (machine learning)
- Random Forest (machine learning)
