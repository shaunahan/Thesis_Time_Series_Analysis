# Time Series Analysis on U.S. Unemployment Rate
This repository contains codes used for my thesis on time series forecasting. 
The aim of my analysis is to use the unemployment rate data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to propose a time series model that accurately predicts the U.S. unemployment rate. Traditional time series models such as ARIMA and ARMA models as well as machine learning algorithms were compared for their forecast performance.
