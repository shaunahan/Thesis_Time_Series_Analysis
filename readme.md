# Time Series Analysis on U.S. Unemployment Rate
This repository contains codes used for my thesis on the U.S. unemployment rate time series forecasting. 
The aim of my analysis is to use the unemployment rate time series provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to propose a time series model that accurately forecast the U.S. unemployment rate. Traditional time series models such as ARIMA and ARMA models as well as machine learning algorithms were compared for their prediction performance.
